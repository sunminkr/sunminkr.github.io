<h3> Happen </h3>
<p>A group project for our junior software engineering class inspired by problem using paper tickets for school bus.
  <br>We want to create a tool that can replace paper tickets. Users can simply log-in to this application using school mobile student ID application to get their own QR code (which takes role of paper ticket).
  <br> We also add several services including payment, tracking bus location, and showing available seats. This to be a helpful supporting application for future school bus users. Currently in development. </p>
